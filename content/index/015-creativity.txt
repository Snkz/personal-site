Creative power

Short one to vent... creativity is difficult. Voxel art is a limiting media and even here the space feels too large. I am extremly grateful for the work of others as the art I see online has been a consistent source of inspiration for what elements to add to a scene, for how to colour a character and what the models should look like.

For years my work has been based on existing IP or characters I've fallen in love with. Hoping at some point that pattern changes but for now its been fun at least. Being able to skip the "what" and going straight into the "how" seems helpful. Soon i'd like to share an example of that on twitter again with some recent work I've been doing unrelated to the game.

If you are interested, look at my retweets. Generally each post has something in there that has made me think "I want to do that..."
