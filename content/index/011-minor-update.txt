Minor Update

I'm glad no one held their breath!

My continued time with FGC here at vsb has consumed most of my free weekends and its been too much fun to really stop! Non stop new releases are grabbing my attention and the grind itself has always been super captivating. If you are interested in this, please check out the vancouver street battle streams!

Besides gaming I have made time to do engine work occasionally, the game itself however seems further and further out! Not entirely sure how to solve battle design issues I've been running into. I'm seriously considering making something smaller to just get it out there but even that is hard! How do people come up with game ideas really??? I'm considering redoing an older Tron project in the new engine but even that is not super exciting to me. A simple arcade like game however is definetly the direction I'd like to go!

Summer is coming to end, hoping to find inspiration again soon, but until then i'll continue to tool around and see what comes of it!

I'm glad I put out this website tool though look how much use its getting :)
