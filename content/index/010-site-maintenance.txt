Site Maintenance and Tooling

I'm writing this late into the night, after finally completing it. At the request of my sister i've written tooling to generate blog posts based on what I've done here. After writing the scripts I did the slow tedious work of migrating everything I've written so far on this site to be generated using the new tooling. You can check out the project here <a href="https://github.com/Snkz/basic-site-template">on my github</a>. Its simply a pair of bash scripts that takes text files and applies html templates to them to generate webpages. The sidebar and header are templated out, the contents of these sections are written once and applied to every "blog" entry found in the content directory. After the pages are all spit out, another script gets run that moves it all over to the webserver im running this on.

Theres a few bits missing, I need to both nuke the directory on the server before beginning the copy and I need to automate copying the non-generated files like js and game files (which reminds me i never did link the <a href="http://abdi.dahir.ca/game/breakblox.html"> webgl voxel engine</a> i made did I?) over to the server as well. They are a one time copy but for completeness the tooling should cover it. Especially if I plan on nuking the directory

Also a bit tedious but I cannot get the server to trust my public key, I'll probably need to update the server distro, w/e its running but who wants to do that.

With this I might actually blog at a regular pace :O

I wouldn't hold my breathe though...
