UI and text rendering woes

<strong>Work work work,</strong>  but I've made some time to look at the engine a bit more.

So I've been looking at performance and started measuring specific parts of the rendering pipeline. I haven't been getting good FPS lately and I mostly assumed it was due to the voxel code, hence all the threading work. What I forgot to pay attention to was the text rendering code I slapped in! It alone took up two thirds of my rendering time! It obviously needed to go!

I've been using FreeType <a href="https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenGL_Programming/Modern_OpenGL_Tutorial_Text_Rendering_01"/> following this very helpful guide</a> which got me to a point where I could simply write text to the screen. However due to the lack of caching and constant texture generation, my FPS took a serious hit. At the time, I was still at 60FPS (I normally have vsync on blah) so it went unnoticed and performance was not my first priority.

I had the option of figuring out how to improve on this or move away from it entirely and finally start looking at some UI libs. I decided to go with the latter and have started using <a href="https://github.com/ocornut/imgui">ImGui</a> a very self contained library that does basically everything  I need currently. My FPS on my windows machine is now at something ridiculous like 1200FPS in top down view and around 500FPS in free cam.

Obviously I'm pretty happy with the switch, I'm not too sure how practical this lib will be in the long run but I'm tempted to find out :p
