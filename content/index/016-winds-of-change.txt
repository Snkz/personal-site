Winds of change!

Almost half way through the year, can you beleive it! 
<br/>

It's hard to describe the mental fog covid cast on me but it finally feels like its been lifted. These months have been <i>long</i> in the best possible way. I'm extremly grateful for everyone and everything that has happened this year so far; I'm homing to continue to tap into this energy for the summer and winter months.

Due to work and other life things, I can't help but feel like things are about to change drastically again. Future me, dont lose sight of your goals! Release the demo!!!
