Property and adjustments

I am crossing a new but terrifiying milestone ... I am now a property owner!

It's an unusual feeling. The fear of managing such a large debt at the potentially most chaotic point in my adult life. Nothing about the economy, my work or my passions are a given currently, and that fear is compunded knowing that the benefits of a first time home buyer are entirely lost if this purchase turns out to be a dud. If I am forced to sell, even at a small profit from this point, I am screwed financially for years...

However, it can be a positive if things stay okay. 

It is unfortunate also that my future game jam and indie endeavors have also been shaken up. Feel a bit silly now announcing this so publicly at the time but things seemed so stable and the adventure was too exciting, I wanted to yell about it!!! I don't really regret it at all though, the experience was worth it, I can wipe the egg off my face.

All is not lost however, my work on the engine and side projects out of it will continue. I'll show conviction here in this time of great change. I've been searching for focus for so long and I found it through community and a partner. I'll take those lessons to maintain this momentum, w/e remains of it.

Employment will be key for the next three years, I don't know how I'll adjust to this enviorment change but nothing has really been too much for me before so...

<b>Focus!!!!!!!!!!</b>
