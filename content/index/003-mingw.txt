Cross compilation with mingw

So first, I'd like start out by thanking all the compiler people out there. Honestly, you don't get enough love. You're all the best.

My experience with emscripten has been mostly great, ignoring the SDL2 hiccups I ran into, porting to the web was surprisingly easy. I feared the worst for mingw though, so I originally attempted to port the code over to Visual Studio. ... which was incredibly painful.

Turns out mingw is not so bad, as long as you are on Arch Linux! Every library that you would like cross compiled has been packaged up nicely for you in the AUR. The only thing you need to do is include them. I did this and boom my code ran on ...

The only tricky bit is sorting out the Makefile required. I've attached the one I used which will hook up your SDL2, GLEW, freetype GLM and lua dependancies. I installed each one of this packages again using the AUR mingw-w64-* version. I believe 64 bit is required to get C++ threading to work out of the box. Either way, you can pick to build a 32 bit version simply by changing the architecture in the Makefile from x86_64 to say i686.

I'm a bit of a Makefile noob, so please excuse any strangeness. (Like how i'm creating a 'exe' main without the proper extension

<br/>
A few interesting things about this Makefile: <br/>1. The mingw32/include/ section deals with GLM and Lua automatically as I installed both of them via AUR so they were added into the folder correctly. Even though GLM doesn't need to compiled, Its more convient to just have it included the same way the other libs are<br/>2. -DGLEW_STATIC and -static flag are REQUIRED, mingw is more then happy to dynamically link to libraries, this forces SDL2 and GLEW to compile statically<br/>3. I have no idea what the libs after the sdl config to -lglew32 are, but I do know that SDL2 will not link without them. They seem to have something to do with window's keyboard handling? 


I also put in a TOOOON of working making the terrain infinite. I would love to dedicate a blog post to it but I don't think I'm done with it just yet.I would love for it to be faster, but hey ... looks pretty no?

Really though, I intend to make the game ... soon. Next post HAS to be update game content.
